## Introduction

This test plan outlines the testing approach for the FinOps Copilot system. It defines the test strategy, test cases, test environment, and test schedule to ensure the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

### Objectives

- Verify that all components of the FinOps Copilot system function correctly
- Validate that the system meets all specified requirements
- Ensure the system integrates properly with AWS services and external tools
- Identify and address any defects or issues before deployment
- Verify system performance, security, and scalability

### Scope

This test plan covers the following components of the FinOps Copilot system:

- Streamlit frontend application
- AWS Bedrock agents (Orchestrator, Service, and Strategy agents)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication framework
- External tool integrations
- AWS service integrations

## Test Environment

### Development Environment

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Python Version**: 3.11
- **Node.js Version**: 18.x
- **AWS CLI Version**: 2.x
- **AWS SAM CLI Version**: 1.x
- **Docker Version**: 20.x

### Test Environment

- **AWS Account**: Dedicated test account with appropriate permissions
- **AWS Region**: us-east-1 (primary), us-west-2 (secondary for multi-region tests)
- **AWS Services**: Lambda, API Gateway, App Runner, S3, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, IAM, Secrets Manager

- **AWS Region**: Same as production
- **Data Volume**: Scaled-down version of production data
- **User Load**: Simulated user load based on expected production usage

## Test Strategy

### Test Levels

1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete workflows from user input to system response
4. **Performance Testing**: Test system performance under various conditions
5. **Security Testing**: Test system security and vulnerability protection

### Test Types

1. **Functional Testing**: Verify system functionality against requirements
2. **Non-Functional Testing**: Verify performance, security, usability, etc.
3. **Regression Testing**: Verify that changes do not break existing functionality
4. **Smoke Testing**: Quick tests to verify basic functionality
5. **Exploratory Testing**: Ad-hoc testing to discover unexpected issues

### Test Approach

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Write tests before implementing features
2. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Run tests automatically on code changes
3. **Automated Testing**: Automate as many tests as possible
4. **Manual Testing**: Perform manual tests for complex scenarios and usability
