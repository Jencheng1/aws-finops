# EC2 Drill-Down Feature Summary

## What Was Fixed

The EC2 drill-down functionality in the Cost Intelligence dashboard has been successfully implemented with the following fixes:

### 1. Fixed Syntax Errors
- Corrected indentation issues in the drill-down section
- Fixed mismatched try-except blocks
- Removed orphaned `col2` reference that was causing structural issues

### 2. EC2 Instance Details Integration
The dashboard now properly integrates with the `get_ec2_details_with_costs.py` utility to show:
- **Instance-level details**: Instance ID, Name, Type, State
- **Performance metrics**: CPU utilization (average and max)
- **Cost information**: Period costs, monthly costs, annual costs
- **Optimization status**: Identifies underutilized and stopped instances

### 3. Enhanced Features
When viewing EC2 service costs, users now have:
- **Comprehensive metrics**: 6 key metrics showing instance counts, states, and savings potential
- **Interactive filtering**: Filter by state, instance type, and optimization status
- **Column selection**: Choose which columns to display in the instance table
- **Visual analytics**: 
  - Instance type distribution chart
  - Cost breakdown by instance state
  - CPU utilization distribution for running instances
- **CSV export**: Download full instance details with all metrics

### 4. Graceful Fallback
If the EC2 utility is not available, the dashboard:
- Shows an error message explaining the issue
- Falls back to showing the usage type breakdown from Cost Explorer
- Maintains functionality without breaking the entire dashboard

## How to Use

1. Go to the **Cost Intelligence** tab
2. Scroll down to **Service Drill-Down Analysis**
3. Select **AmazonEC2** from the dropdown
4. The dashboard will display:
   - Summary metrics for your EC2 fleet
   - Detailed instance table with filtering options
   - Visual charts for analysis
   - CSV export button for detailed reporting

## Technical Details

- **Data Source**: Combines AWS EC2 API for instance details with CloudWatch for metrics
- **Cost Calculation**: Uses instance runtime and pricing to calculate accurate monthly costs
- **Performance**: Caches results for 5 minutes to avoid excessive API calls
- **Compatibility**: Works with all EC2 instance types and regions
